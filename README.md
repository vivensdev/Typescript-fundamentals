Play project for learning and practicing TypeScript

## TypeScript Fundamentals
* Why use TypeScript?
    * JavaScript can feel messy!
    * We want maintainable code
    * Function Spaghetti Code -> Ravioli Code (Revealing Pattern)
    * JS provides a dynamic type system
        * The Good
            * Variables can hold any object
            * Types determined on the fly
            * Implicit type coercion (ex: string to number)
        * The Bad
            * Difficult to ensure proper types are passed without tests
            * Not all developers use ===
            * Enterprise-scale apps can have 1000s of lines of code to maintain
* TypeScript Features
    * Supports standard JS code
    * Provides static typing
    * Encapsulation through classes and modules
    * Support for constructors, properties, functions
    * Define interfaces
    * Arrow function (=>) support
    * Intellisense and syntax checking
